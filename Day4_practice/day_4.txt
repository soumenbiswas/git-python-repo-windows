1.	Strings are IMMUTEABLE
		This means that we cannot change the part of a string, but if we want to change completly 
		then we can change.

2.	strip operation:
		strip will delete spaces in your string, that may be on the left side or the right side 
		of the string
		
	#print my_string.strip()
		this will delete the spaces from both left and rigt side
	
	#print my_string.lstrip()
		this will delete the spaces from lefdt side of the string
	
	#print my_string.rstrip()
		this will delete the spaces from right side of the string
		
	
	** we can delete perticular word or letter by using strip operation.
		
		
		my_string="java 1.7.05"
		my_java=my_string.strip("java ")	
		print "my_java variable"		//storing it into a variable
		print my_java
		
	** using multiple strip operations
	
		my_string = "hello how are you"
		print my_string.strip('hello').strip('you')
		
		output: how are

Data structre :

	are used to arrange data.
	
		-list	--->	[]	--> mutable	--> some parts of the list data can be changed
		-tuple	--->	()	-->	immutable --> some parts of the tuple cannot be changed/ just like strings
		-dict	--->	{}	-->	mutable --> u can change the parts of a dictionary
		=========
		-set	--->	set{} --->
