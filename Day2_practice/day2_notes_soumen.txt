Python Day2 Notes:
-------------------



1.	Commenting out multiple lines using ''' (triple cotations)
2.	we can use double cotations three times also to commenting out  """
3.	\n    is used to break the lines into multiple lines
4.	when we put sting to a variable we will always use cotations, may be a single cotation , double cotation, triple cotation.
5.	to print different variables in a sigle line we need to place commas
	
		x=5
		y=11
		z=3av
		
		print x,y,z
		
		output: 5 11 3av
		
6.	to print the value of a variable with statement
		
			x=3
			print "the value of x is : ",x
	
7.	to split lines in a print statement
	
		print "x=",x,"\ny=",y,"\nz=",z

8.	how to print the momory location in RAM where the variable is stored
		
		print id(X)

-------------		

TYPE CASTING or TYPE CONVERSION

	
9.	we can covert a number into a string
	
		x=4				//this will be stored as a number
		y=str(x)		//this value of x will be stored as string
		
10.	we can convert string which is a number as number	

		x="4"				//here 4 is a number which is get stored as a string
		y=int(x)			//this value of x will be stored as a integer here.
	

	but sting with a pure string value cannot be converted into integer or float
-----------------------	

Rules to define Variable names:
--------------------------------
	1. variable name should contain only a-z,A-Z,0-9 and _ only.
	2. Dont start with number.
	3. Should not contain space.
	4. case-sensitive
	5. it should not a key word(pre-defined words)
	

----------------------

12.	How to delete a variable

		del x
		
13.	Another print format which is used mostly

	print "x={},y={},z={}"format(x,y,z)
